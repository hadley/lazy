```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

Take the following example:

```{r}
library(lazyeval)
f1 <- function(x) lazy(x)
g1 <- function(y) f1(y)

g1(a + b)
```

`lazy()` returns `a + b` because it always tries to find the top-level promise.

In this case the process looks like this:

1. Find the object that `x` is bound to.
2. It's a promise, so find the expr it's bound to (`y`, a symbol) and the
   environment in which it should be evaluated (the environment of `g()`).
3. Since `x` is bound to a symbol, look up its value: it's bound to a promise.
4. That promise has expression `a + b` and should be evaluated in the global
   environment.
5. The expression is not a symbol, so stop.

Occasionally, you want to avoid this recursive behaviour, so you can use `follow_symbol = FALSE`:

```{r}
f2 <- function(x) lazy(x, .follow_symbols = FALSE)
g2 <- function(y) f2(y)

g2(a + b)
```

Or, you may want to capture the expression from the function that called it (if for example,
you want to check in a data.frame first using the `data` argument of `lazy_eval()`). In this case
you can specify an integer number of times to follow symbols.

```{r}
f3 <- function(x) lazy(x, .follow_symbols = 1)
g3 <- function(y) f3(y)

g3(a + b)
```

All of these expressions will evaluate to the same result:

```{r}
a <- 10
b <- 1

lazy_eval(g1(a + b))
lazy_eval(g2(a + b))
lazy_eval(g3(a + b))
```

Note that the resolution of chained promises only works with unevaluated objects. This is because R deletes the information about the environment associated with a promise when it has been forced, so that the garbage collector is allowed to remove the environment from memory in case it is no longer used. `lazy()` will fail with an error in such situations.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
var <- 0

f3 <- function(x) {
  force(x)
  lazy(x)
}

f3(var)
## Error: Promise has already been forced
```
